EXPUNGED 2025-01-02

This script used BANNED database-based playset creation.
Playsets are now file-based JSON. See:
- playsets/*.json for playset definitions
- server.py ck3_playset for MCP tool
- docs/PLAYSET_ARCHITECTURE.md for architecture

The original create_playset.py created playsets in SQL tables (playsets, playset_mods).
That architecture is BANNED - see CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md.
