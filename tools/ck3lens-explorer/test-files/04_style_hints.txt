# PURPOSE: Test detection of style issues and common mistakes (non-blocking)
# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
#   - HINT on line 16: "yes" is typically a value, not a key (STYLE003)
#   - HINT on line 21: Use single = for assignment (STYLE004) 
#   - HINT on line 27: Missing = before { (STYLE005)
# =============================================================================
# These are not parse errors but style/usage hints that help catch mistakes.
# =============================================================================
